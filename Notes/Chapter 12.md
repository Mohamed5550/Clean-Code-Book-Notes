# Chapter 12: Emergence

- According to `Kent`, a design is simple if it follows:
  - Runs all the tests
  - Contains no duplications
  - Expresses the intent of the programmer
  - Minimizes the number of classes and methods

## Rule 1: Runs all the tests

- We need to have tests, and run them frequently

## Rules 2 - 4: Refactoring

`The fact that we have these tests eliminates the fear
that cleaning up the code will break it!`

- No duplication
- Expressive
- Minimal classes and methods

# Introduction

- The only valid measurements of code quality is WTFs/minute
- How we can make sure our code is good? The answer is `Craftsmanship`
- There are two parts to learn about caftsmanship:
  - Knowledge: You must get the knowledge of principles, patterns and practices
  - Work: You should practice these knowledge by working hard
- This book is not only teaching you the principles and patterns, It needs you practice, fail, and watchcing other people fail
- The book is divided into 3 parts
  - First part is the principles and patterns you should lear, there is a little code in these chapters
  - Second part is the case studies, which is the harder part of the book, it contains many case studies and transformation of bad code to good code
  - The last part is only one chapter that contain heuristics about what the authors felt and thought about the case studies
